# Atom FTP

Associate your local project directory with a directory on a remote FTP server.  Similar to
Espresso, this package allows you to automatically upload files on save, or manually.

This package can also watch files, and automatically upload watched files when they are changed.

The FTP details are saved as JSON into the project directory.  The password is saved as plaintext currently.  You should not be using FTP for
production deployments anyway...

Currently does not support SFTP.
